A simple, responsive image search engine built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, powered by the **Unsplash API**.

## 🎯 Why This Project?
This project was designed to:
- Enhance my **front-end development skills**.

- Learn and implement **responsive web design** principles.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
